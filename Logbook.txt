January 2016 – decided on Capstone Project, started researching software side

Summer 2016 → January 2018 – Software design, both backend (Java, mysql) and frontend (php/HTML). Will add more details later based on Git commits. Stuff tried and didn’t work, mistakes made in code, etc.

January 3rd, 2018 – Asked Robert about recommendations on hardware. Started looking up chips.
January 9th, 2018 – Asked Robert opinion about FTDI FT232R IC. He told me it is UART and is not the correct chip. He recommended MAX232. Sought clarification from Brian on the voltage levels required for RS232. He recommended CP2202 chip. Researched difference between UART and RS232 online. After a discussion with Robert, determined by my own reading of the datasheets, that I require a MAX232 with a UART chip. I decided to use a MCP2200 as the UART chip because it is available as a SOIC, which is easier to solder to the board. The MAX232 is available as both a DIP and a SOIC. I plan on ordering the SOIC version of the MAX232.
January 10th, 2018 – Discussed with Robert required power for the sign. Possibly 120V AC, not checked internally yet. Robert found seven MAX232 chips that I can use.
January 11th, 2018 – Looked up online how to design custom chip (footprint only) in Multisim. Started designing custom chip in Multisim (for board layout) for MCP2200. Searched online looking for the differences between MCP2200 versions. Discussed in class fall-back options, in my case it would be to use an off-the-shelf USB to Serial RS232 cable. I already have one at home.
	With Robert’s help, I took apart the Series Two screen to examine it. The screen is currently hooked up to accept a RS422 connection. I plan to reconfigure it to accept a RS232 connection with Rx, Tx, and GND. The Rx to accept the message plus checksum, etc. The Tx to send back a confirmation code. The screen currently has address 1. Sent e-mail to Robert asking him to order two MCP2200-I-SO chips.
January 13, 2018 – Created a function diagram for the USB to RS232 board I plan to create. It is located in my Dropbox folder. Found typical circuit configuration for the MAX232, p.10 of its datasheet. It requires 4 – 1µF capacitors.
January 15, 2018 – Discussion with Robert and Brian. Determined that I will solder a USB mini connector (female) on one side of the board and a DB9 (female) on the other side. Signed up for no-ip.com DDNS. Use: eetsign.ddns.net Mistake, should be DB9 (Male), just stated wrong. Discussed DynDNS with Darrell across the hall, not a lot of help but I did get a better understanding of DynDNS. Talked to Shawn downstairs about DynDNS, found out that it is not possible on the school network. I will have to use my own router and connect the PI and my computer to the router to access the PI's webserver.
                    Found an error in the mysql database, both on the Java side and the php side. Java gives a nice error: Can not issue data manipulation statements with executeQuery(). PHP complains about access denied for user client@localhost.
                    Fixed the mysql errors by removing both the javauser and client and recreating them. Then granting them SELECT and UPDATE privileges.
January 17, 2018 - Robert told me that the MCP2200 chip had a 5 week lead time on it. I found a different site online, arrow.com, that could ship it the next day. 
                    I ordered it from arrow.com, using my credit card. Discussion with Brian about ordering and designing PCBs. He suggests ExpressPCB. 
                    I looked into it a little 3 different designs that are offered in the small size, $41, $51, or $61 for 3 boards.
                    ExpressPCB do offer free board design software. I plan on installing it and start designing the board, once I determine which pins need to be connected where.
January 18, 2018 - Discussion with Brian about solder mask, silk screening and other components required (other than MAX232 and MCP2200).
                    Created a Materials list spreadsheet, in Capstone folder. Built first version of the full circuit in Multisim, file in Capstone folder.
                    I searched for a 12MHz crystal oscillator among the boards in the soldering lab. Ordered crystal oscillator (12MHz) from Arrow, using my credit card.
                    Built custom chips in ExpressPCB software, after asking Brian and Robert some questions about SOIC specifications.
January 19, 2018 - Created a 12MHz crystal layout in ExpressPCB. Made some slight layout changes in Multisim (no wiring changes). 
                    Made the pin numbers line up with there respective pins by editing each chip manually and making the numbers visible.
                    Tried to desolder mini-USB port and DB9 port, was not successful.
                    Found datasheet for DB9 port (put in Capstone folder), started designing ExpressPCB part for it.
January 22, 2018 - Sought help from Brian to desolder DB9 and mini-USB ports. Brian finished desoldering mini-USB port. He helped free up the DB9, I still have to finish desoldering that.
                    I finished desoldering the DB9 port. I bent the pins slightly, but they bent back fine. Robert told me afterwards that he has some straight (not 90 degree) DB9 ports somewhere.
                    I still have to get rid of the solder on the mounting pins on the DB9 port.
                    I done up a fairly exhaustive parts list, including software that runs on the Raspberry Pi and my laptop.
                    Moved stuff around on the MultiSim schematic, it is now easier to read.
                    Started writing Phase 1 Intro, Requirements, Specifications, and Objectives.
January 23, 2018 - Finished creating custom parts in ExpressPCB. Asked Brian a few questions about info on the schematic diagrams in the datasheets. Example: "What does rad mean on the diagram?"
January 24, 2018 - Asked Robert for Vernier Calipers to verify the measurements of the mini USB port. I had to look up online how to read them correctly. The port's dimensions are almost exactly what is in the USB datasheet I used to design the pads.
                    Completed Phase 1 report, including function diagram, MultiSim schematic, introduction, objectives, requirements, specifications, contingency. I also updated the parts list to add some tools that may be required.
                    Sought clarification on the detail Robert is looking for in the Gant chart. Adjusted my Gant chart slightly to fit his outline. 
January 25, 2018 - Added MultiSim and ExpressPCB Plus to software parts list.
                    Formatting changes and correcting grammar in Phase 1 report. Found an error in my MultiSim schematic, RTS and CTS should be tied together.
January 26, 2018 - Started designing first revision of PCB.
January 29, 2018 - Added posAck and negAck for Verify mode in SeriesTwo file. Added, but not completed readAck method in SeriesTwo file.
                    Finished writing readAck method. Changed write method to call readAck and recursively call write method if readAck returns false.
                    Reason for these changes is because I forgot to account for verify mode returning a value.
                    Asked Robert about opening and closing ports, determined that did not have to close port at the end of testWrite or open a new port at the start of testRead.
                    Asked Robert and Brian for 1uF capacitors, have 4 of both electrolytic and ceramic now.
                    Installed Putty to test java program's serial connection.
                    Discussed with Brian some programming errors I am having regarding testRead(), it still comes up with Waiting for Read line but never actually reads anything you type in the connected putty terminal.
January 31, 2018 - Various changes to testRead() and serialEvent methods in Test.java, still does not read correctly. Did ask Brian a quick question about missing variable type, it was supposed to be declared as boolean (ready variable).
                    Discussed with Brian, found my USB power traces were in the wrong places, switched VCC and GND.
                    More wiring in ExpressPCB.
February 1, 2018 - Asked Robert for some 105 (1uF) capacitors and some large (2, 5.6, 10Mohm) resistors. He found them in the storage room.
                    Encountered an inconvenience that I disregarded. A SOIC, which the MCP2200 is, is impossible to place in a breadboard. 
                    After discussing with Robert and Brian, I have decided that I am going to solder wires to only the pins needed. Then place the wires in a zero-insertion-force socket to place it on the board.
                    Slight changes to wiring colours in MultSim, Tx wires are now Blue, Rx wires are now Green.
